Have try various approaches for infinite scrolling in all event page, like the `react-infinite-scroll-component` and `react-infinite-scroller`. However, probably my scrolling part is not in body tag but in a nested div, thus they're not working solution. I should go for intersection observer. But for simplicity I used `innerHeight`, `scrollTop`, and `scrollHeight` instead.

- Add infinite scrolling in all event page
- Clear up all the console.log across files
- Add a spinner when fetching data
- update the Links' href
- Update some responsiveness on mobile in all event page

After updating the API from the backend, the data is much more clean and easy to handle.
- Update the data from API
- Add fallback empty space for leaders name on card
- truncate the event name on card

The update of styles are trying to maintain the same card size in all situation. Like when the event name is too long and wrap to an new line, or the leader name is empty which shrink the height. So that we can prevent the above cases.
